### First Heuristic Evaluation: Consistency and standards

The problem with the app is when an article will open, there will be an icon of source’s publication on the right-hand side of article’s heading. This icon is clickable. This icon and the “Read Source” button will be re-directed to article’s source website. Here, the icon and the name of publication is represented as a person is presented. The standard behavior of this type of items is to link the icon and name to a profile for the person. This problem can be solved by introducing the profile which will be connected to the icon and source name. The profile will list all the articles or news published by the source.

### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Flexibility and Efficiency of use

Whenever an article is open, the image of the articles covers most of the phone while the other space is covered heading, by-line, and some ad as this app is freely available. Thus, to read the first line of the article, a scroll is required. One idea to solve this issue is to decrease the size of the image and the size of the heading. Another suggestion for this could be, provide a preview of the article on force touch.
